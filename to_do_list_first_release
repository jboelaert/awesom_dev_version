Done
* Scales option visible for CatBarplot
* Plot vars selection updates change only when necessary (when previously selected variables are no longer present in the import data)
* Fixed bug in repro script: training data to matrix when no scale() is called

For future version:
* better explanation of range
* add message in shiny when file is too large
* import csv encoding options "whatever else" !!
* plot option: hide obs names
* console-callable reorder variables
* radar axes -> straight
* better legend
* legends in exported svg
* quality measures on plot page? 

Wishlist
* Training vars selection as a (html) multiple input, with separate weights section
* support for additional observations
* obs cloud plot (with legend showing selected point's data)
* support for qual variables (MCA)
